## Overview

**Project Title**: CFB Playoff Predictor

**Project Description**: Users can predict which teams will make the College Football Playoffs and view how the playoff bracket will look based on their predictions.

**Project Goals**: The goal is to provide a fun and ineractive way for people to predict the College Football Playoff teams and see how the playoff bracket will look based on their predictions.

## Instructions for Build and Use

Steps to build and/or run the software:
1. Install nvm on your computer to ensure you have the latest version of Node.js. (you'll need version 14.0 or later)
2. run `npm run build` to build the web app.

Instructions for using the software:

1. Drag and drop the teams who you think will make the playoffs.
2. Once you dragged and dropped 12 teams, click the 'Create Bracket' button to see the playoff bracket.

## Development Environment 

To recreate the development environment, you need the following software and/or libraries with the specified versions:

* run `npx create-react-app my-ap cd my-app` to create a new React app.
* run `npm start` to start the app. run `npm install react-dnd` and `npm install react-dnd-html5-backend` to install libraries * necessary for drag and drop.

## Future Work

The following items I plan to fix, improve, and/or add to this project in the future:

* [ ] Add a feature to allow users to predict the playoff games.
* [ ] Add a feature to allow users to predict the national championship game and score.
* [ ] Add a feature to allow users to recieve a score based on how accurate their predictions were.
* [ ] Add a feature to allow users to create an account and save their predictions.
* [ ] Add a feature to allow users to view other users' predictions on a leaderboard.



Below is Some Information on the Create React App that was provided when the project was created:


# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can't go back!**

If you aren't satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you're on your own.

You don't have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn't feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn't be useful if you couldn't customize it when you are ready for it.
